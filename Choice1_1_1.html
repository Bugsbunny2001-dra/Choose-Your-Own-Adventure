 <p>you run down to third class and begin to scream</p>
 <p>"THE SHIP IS SINKING THE SHIP IS SINKING"</p>
 <p>you bang on the doors as sleepy people crawl into the hall</p>
 <p> all of a sudden the floor begins to slant</p>
 <p>everthing and everyone starts to slide down the hall like a bowling game</p>
 <p>you try to catch some of the kids, as you grab a hand railing</p>
 <p> you look down the hall as water starts to flow in</p>
 <h1>What do you do?</h1>
 <a href="Choice1_1_1_1.html">Let the kids fall to their death and save yourself</a>
 <p>or</p>
 <a href="Choice1_1_1_2.html">sacrifice yourself to save the kids</a>
