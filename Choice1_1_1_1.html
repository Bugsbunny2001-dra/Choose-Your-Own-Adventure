  <p>You let go of the kids, and they slide into the crashing wave.</p>
  <p>you turn and begin to quickly climb the stair well as water fills each level of the ship</p>
  <p>the incline of the floor feels like its at 65*.... everything and everyone is sliding down into the water</p>
  <p>but you keep going, you get up to the top deck and realize, all the lifeboats are gone....</p>
  <p>you run to the front of the ship and grab the railing as the ship goes completely vertical</p>
  <p>then the boat snaps in half and begins to sink faster</p>
  <p>you see the water rushing towards you, its then you wish you had learned how to swim</p>
